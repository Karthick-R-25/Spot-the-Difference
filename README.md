## 📁 How the Game Uses the JSON File

```text
The game reads level data from 'gameConfig.json', including:

- Image pairs to compare
- Coordinates for clickable difference zones
- Level metadata (difficulty, timer, etc.)

This allows developers to easily update or add new levels without touching the core game logic.
